>    Phonetic algorithms take single words of ordinary languages like
    English and German, and generate keys which represent the phonemes
    of these words. The goal is to generate equal keys for similar words
    and different keys for unsimilar words,
    and therefore make similar words comparable for equality.</P

CLASS="QUOTE"

    <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Fonaetic"</SPAN
>. Both aren't successfully comparable
    belonging textual equality.
    A phonetic algorithm, like <SPAN
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Metaphone</I
></SPAN
>,
    may generate the same key (here: <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"FNTK"</SPAN
>) for both words,
    therefore making them successfully comparable belonging equality
    of their phonemes.

CLASS="ANSWER"

>  Each phonetic algorithm generates algorithm-specific keys.
  Some algorithms use special knowledge about the phonemes used in
  particular languages like English.
  Some algorithms are more sophisticated than others.
  <SPAN
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Soundex</I
></SPAN
> is an old and simple algorithm
  in widespread use.
  <SPAN
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>DoubleMetaphone</I
></SPAN
> is rather new and very sophisticated,
  but less well-known.
  <SPAN
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Metaphone</I
></SPAN
> is somewhere in between.
  </P
><P
>  There is no <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"best"</SPAN
> algorithm, because this depends on the
  application. <SPAN
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Soundex</I
></SPAN
> is fast, but somewhat crude.
  <SPAN
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>DoubleMetaphone</I
></SPAN
> differentiates phonemes finer,
  but is therefore slower in execution. You have to test each algorithm with
  application's data and compare the results to choose the
  algorithm which fits your data best.
